Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.



CREATE TABLE workouts (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
date TEXT,
exercise TEXT,
duration INTEGER,
calories_burned INTEGER
);

-- Insert some example data
INSERT INTO workouts (date, exercise, duration, calories_burned)
VALUES ("2023-04-30", "Running", 30, 300);

INSERT INTO workouts (date, exercise, duration, calories_burned)
VALUES ("2023-04-30", "Weightlifting", 45, 200);

-- Emulate editing a workout
UPDATE workouts
SET duration = 60
WHERE exercise = "Running";

-- Emulate deleting a workout
DELETE FROM workouts
WHERE exercise = "Weightlifting";

-- Check the final table to make sure everything looks right
SELECT * FROM workouts;
